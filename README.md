# Car Sales Analytics Webapp

This project is a Python-based web application developed to explore and visualize used car sales data through an interactive interface.

The application allows users to filter vehicle listings by brand and vehicle type, view key summary metrics (KPIs), and explore the data using visualizations such as a price distribution histogram and a price versus odometer scatter plot.

The main goal of the project is to practice software engineering fundamentals, including project structure, virtual environment management, data handling with pandas, interactive visualization with Plotly, and building a web application using Streamlit.

### Features
- Interactive filtering by vehicle brand and type
- Key metrics such as total listings, median price, and median odometer
- Histogram showing the distribution of vehicle prices
- Scatter plot visualizing the relationship between price and mileage
- Optional dataset viewer for inspecting filtered data

This project was developed as part of a Data Analytics bootcamp, with a focus on applying engineering best practices rather than deep statistical analysis.
